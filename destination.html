          enjoy the white sandy beaches on all the islands. But Havelock and
          Neil islands have some of the best snorkelling and diving sites in the
          whole of Andaman. The submerged seascapes and the corals will
          mesmerise you with their colourful beauty.

          Goa is an adrenaline pumping joyride. The flea market at Anjuna is a

          them are meant just for lounging on the beach. It still retains its
